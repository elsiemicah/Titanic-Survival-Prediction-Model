# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

This model predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, etc. It uses a Logistic Regression algorithm for binary classification. The model analyzes various passenger attributes such as age, gender, ticket, class and fare to determine the likelihood of survival.

## Dataset

The model utilizes the Titanic dataset, which includes information about individual passengers such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```
    pip install pandas seaborn scikit-learn
    ```

3. Run the model:

    ```
    python titanic_survival_prediction.py
    ```

## Model Performance

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and classification report metrics. These metrics provide insights into how well the model performs in predicting whether a passenger survived or not.
